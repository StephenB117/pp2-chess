# Chess Puzzle Run

## Features:

### Image generation:
A random puzzle image is generated for the user to work out the best move. 

### Scoring:
When the user enters the correct move the score is increased by 1 and a new image is generated. The game stops when the user enters an incorrect move.  

### Leaderboard:
When the game ends the user is given a prompt to enter a username which adds their chosen name and score to the leaderboard. 

## My Logic: 
On the site loading an image is randomly selected from the assets.

Depending on the image the user will be told either white or black to play. 

The user will enter their answer into two answer boxes. "From" being the piece "To" move to being the square to take. 

Once the user submits their answer the answer is checked against the image. 

If the user submitted the correct answer the score is incremented by 1 and a new image is generated. 

If the user submits an incorrect answer the game ends and a prompt to enter their username appears. 

The username is then added to the leaderboard as well as their score. 

If the user has a score of 0 they will not be added to the leaderboard.
